Introduction

This Code book describes the data resulting from running the
run_analysis.R script against the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones
Data Set available here:
 http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/.
For details of what the run_analysis.R script does and how to run it, 
see the accompanying README.md file.

General Technical Information

The data consists of 180 rows (plus one header row) and 68 columns.  The first
two columns (activity and subject_id) are factors and the remaining columns are
all numeric variables.  The data is in text format with fields separated by
comma.  The first two fields (activity and subject_id) are enclosed by double
quotes.  The first row contains column names which are comma separated and
double quote enclosed.

Study Design

The study which created the original data was carried out by Jorge L.
Reyes-Ortiz, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Davide Anguita in November 2012.  This
Code Book relates to post processing applied to the results of this study.  The
basis of the post processing is to create a data set that combines the training
and test data from the original study and to select only those variables that
recorded a mean or standard deviation measurement.  These variables were then
summarised by taking the mean of all observations for each variable grouped by
subject and activity.  The resulting data set can then be used for follow on
analysis.  Full details of how the original data was collected and how
observations were made can be found in README and info files which accompany the
original data.


Code Book

There follows a detailed description of each column that appears in the
summarised data produced by running the run_analysis.R script against the
original data. For every Variable Name  listed below the value is the mean of
all observations on that variable for the given subject and activity.  All
variables denoted as time_based represent a measurement in the time domain.  All
variables denoted as frequency based represent a measurement in frequency
domain.  The original values were taken from the gyroscope and accelerometer of
a Samsung Galaxy SII.  The original accelerometer readings are in standard
gravity units and the gyroscope readings are in radians per second.  Note that
the variable names are different from those found in the original data.  To
understands what transformations were applied to the variable names please see
the accompanying README.md
